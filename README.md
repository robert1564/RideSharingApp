# RideSharingApp
This is a RideSharingApp for Android devices, developed in Flutter and the database is created in Firebase.

Can be run on both android and iOS devices, due to Flutter language, which give my the opportunity to run on two platform without having to make a major changes in my code. App is divided into two parts: rider part and driver part. 

From rider side: 
  - User can order a car;
  - See the nearby cars available on the map;
  - See the overall route;
  - See the auto-generated price for the trip;
  - Time until the driver arrive to the indicated location;
  - Can call the driver after he pick it up the trip;

From driver side:
  - Can see the order trips;
  - Auto-generate the map route to pick up rider;
  - See the income from every trip directly into account;
  - Can go online or offline on app;

This RideSharingApp has: 
  - Advanced state management concepts with the provider package;
  - User can initiate a phone call directly from app;
  - Create, Remove, Update, Delete records in Firebase Database;
  - Can find place adress with location coordinates using Google Geocoding API;
  - User firendly interfaces for both android and iOS;
  - Creating the Push Notification messages only with Firebase (FCM - can send HttpWebRequest from a single device);
  - Google Places API which gave me the possibility to obtain informations, with which I can make predictions about a given location using some search interogations;
  - Directions API which gave me directions between multiple locations;
  - A algorith for calculating the total ride price based on: base fare, distance fare and time fare;

The app using following dart libraries:
  - Firebase_core - enable connection to multiple Firebase apps;

  - Animated_text_kit - for user eye catching design;
